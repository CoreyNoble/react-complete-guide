85. A Better Project Structure
------------------------------------

In previous examples we organized components in a sub-optimal way. Ideally we should re-organize our file structure to follow a convention, in-order make it easier to navigate through and find files in our application.

The standard approach would look something like:
--
/src/index.js
/src/App.js
/src/assets/....
/src/components/Persons/Persons.js
/src/components/Persons/Person/Person.js
/src/containers/....
/src/hoc/....
/src/hooks/....
/src/shared/....
/src/store/actions/....
/src/store/reducers/....
/src/store/sagas/....
--

The primary files in the application (App, index, ...) should be in the root of the /src/ folder.

Assets (eg. Images, Documents, ...) Should be placed inside of an /assets/ folder.

Components should be placed inside of a /components/ folder, and nested inside of eachother when it makes sense (eg. /Person/ inside of /Persons/).

Containing components should be placed inside of a /containers/ folder.

Higher-order components should be placed inside of an /hoc/ folder.

Custom Hooks should be placed in a /hooks/ folder.

Shared functionality (eg. utility.js) should be put in a /shared/ folder.

Anything to do with a global store (eg. Redux) should be placed inside of a /store/ folder.


When finished re-organizing the project structure, we need to ensure every file that imports a component has that path adjusted to match the new location of that file.



------------------------------------
86. Splitting an App Into Components
------------------------------------

We should be splitting up our application as often as we can, to enure every component serves only one purpose. Doing so will keep our application modular, manageable, flexible and scalable. 

We keep as many of these components stateless as possible to ensure we can control the data flow in as few locations as possible.

An example of this would be if you're adding a list of 'Persons' inside of your app, you can create a 'Persons.js' component which would handle the list, 'props' for each item in the list, and passing data on each item back up to the file that controls the state and event handlers (App.js):
--
Persons.js
--
import React from 'react';
import Person from './Person/Person';

const persons = (props) => props.persons.map((person, index) => {
    return <Person 
        click={() => props.clicked(index)}
        name={person.name}
        age={person.age}
        key={person.id}
        changed={(event) => props.changed(event,person.id)}
});

export default persons;
--

--
App.js
--
....

<Persons 
    persons={this.state.persons}
    clicked={this.deletePersonHandler}
    changed={this.nameChangedHandler} />
--

In the example above, 'Persons.js' now handles the mapping for each list item (<Person>), the 'props' for each item, and passing data back up to the stateful component (App.js). 

In 'App.js', <Persons> outputs each <Person> and handles the 'state' and event handlers.



------------------------------------
87. Comparing Stateless and Stateful Components
------------------------------------

When referring to Stateful components (Also called Smart or Container components) it means it's a componnt that manages state. 

Historically, in-order to gain access to the 'state' object inside of a React component it needed to be inside of class based component that 'extends Component'. The 'Component' class gives us access to the 'state' object, and the 'setState()' method.

With React 16+ we can now manage state with react Hooks (shown later in the course), but since all legacy applications will use class based components, below is an example of a Stateful component using the class based approach:
--
class App extends Component {
    state = {
        ....
    }

    ....
        this.setState({ .... });
    ....
}
--

In the example above, the 'state' sets the data and its initial values inside of the application, then later on when we manipulate the state, we use the 'setState()' method.


Stateless components (also called Presentational, Functional or Dumb components) are components that do not manage state.


You should restrict the amount of components in the application that manage state, using as many Stateless components as possible. Doing so helps ensure there is a minimal amount of locations that manage the data of the application. This helps keep your application understandable, manageable, flexible, and scalable. 

Typically an application consists of containers that pull in the components that are relevant to a given section of the application. The containers would be Stateful, and all of the components that are pulled into the container would be Stateless.



------------------------------------
88. Class-based vs Functional Components
------------------------------------

Class-based components:
- class XY extends 'Component
--- Access to State
--- Lifecycle Hooks
--- this.state.XY
--- this.props.XY

Use if you need to manage State or access to Lifecycle Hooks and you don't want to use React Hooks.


Functional components:
- const XY = props => { .... }
--- (React 16+) - Access to State ('useState()' Hook)
--- props.XY

Use in all other cases.


With React 16+, there is now less of a difference between Class-based and Functional components. Both can manage state in their own way, however, Class-based components have access to Lifecycle Hooks, whereas Functional components do not.

If you are working on a project that is below React 16, functional components would not have access to React Hooks, and therefore, could not manage state.

Additionally, Class-based components require you to use the 'this' keyword when accessing 'state' or 'props', whereas Functional components do not.



------------------------------------
89. class Component Lifecycle Overview
------------------------------------

The 'Component Lifecycle' is only available in Class-based components.

*There is a Functional component equivelant for Lifecycle methods using React Hooks, however, they consolidate most of these methods and are not the same. This will be discussed later on in the course.

The Lifecycle methods available to us in Class-based components are:
- constructor()
- getDerivedStateFromProps()
- getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
- componentDidCatch()
- componentWillUnmount()
- shouldComponentUpdate()
- componentDidUpdate()
- componentDidMount()
- render()

The methods listed above can be added to any Class-based component. React will execute these methods for us which run at different points of time within the Lifecycle of React.

Examples of use cases for these methods would be to:
- Fetch some data from the web during a certain point in the Lifecycle.
- Clean-up some data before an item is removed from the DOM.

So, how exactly can we use them and when in the Lifecycle are these methods executed?:


Component Lifecycle - Creation:

1. constructor(props)

When a component is created, first of all, the 'constructor()' executes. This is not actually a React Lifecycle Hook, this is a default ES6 class feature. This 'constructor()' will recieve 'props'.

The 'constructor()' is added by default in any Class-based component, but you can also add your own 'constructor()'. If you're creating your own 'constructor()', inside of it you have to call 'super(props)'.

What is the 'constructor' used for? You can do basic initialization work (eg. setting an initial 'state').

You shouldn't cause side-effects inside of 'constructor()'. Examples that cause side-effects are:
- Send an HTTP request.
- Store something in Local Storage.
- Send Analytics to Google Analytics.
- ....

Doing so would severly affect performance as it would continually trigger re-render cycles in React.


2. getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)

This is a Lifecycle Hook that has been added since React 16.3. The idea with this Lifecycle Hook is that whenever your props change for your Class-based component, you can sync your 'state' to them.

This is used in very rare and niche cases, you will not use this a lot. But if you have some scenario where props in your component can change, and then you want to update some internal state of that component, this is the hook to use for that.

You shouldn't cause side-effects inside of 'getDerivedStateFromProps()'. Examples that cause side-effects are:
- Send an HTTP request.
- Store something in Local Storage.
- Send Analytics to Google Analytics.
- ....


3. render()

This is the method that returns JSX. You should use this method only to prepare and structure your JSX code (hook up data, render HTML).

When 'render()' executes on any parent component, it will also execute 'render()' on any child components. Only when all of the child 'render()' methods and their Lifecycle Hooks finish, will your parent 'render()' method finish.


4. componentDidMount()

In 'componentDidMount()' you CAN cause side-effects.

This is the typical hook you use to make HTTP requests.

You shouldn't update the 'state' synchronously in this method as that would trigger a re-render cycle in React. 

The only acceptable time to update 'state' in 'componentDidMount()' would be inside of the '.then()' of a promise in an asynchronous HTTP request.
